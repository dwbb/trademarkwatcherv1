This is a first draft of this project. I am fairly new to programming, so this was as much of me getting a lay of the land as it was a project.

The project is based of the paper "Trademarks as Surveillance Transparency" by Amanda Levendowski (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3544195).

The program scrapes the United States Patent and Trademark Office's trademark database using Selenium and searches through the week's trademark entries and searches for entries related to privacy. It them pulls information about those entries into a summary work document.

I am new to programming, so I imagine that there are many ways this could be streamlined. I am looking in to using scrapy instead of selenium to make the process a little faster for one. I am also exploring the API for the trademark database, but it seems a little limited. I would love any suggestions and if any of this is helpful to anyone, I would be happy for you to use it as long as you credit me.
